The `SMHvalidation` R package contains functions to pull COVID-19 data
from the R package `covidcast` (output in the Scenario Modeling Hub
(SMH) standard format), and functions to validate and visualize Scenario
Modeling Hub submission.

For more information on the Scenario Modeling Hub and on how to
participate, please feel free to consult the [Github
Repository](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/)
and/or the [COVID-19 SMH
website](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/).

## Validation on model projection

In this vignette, we will describe all the tests that are made on each
SMH submission when using the function `validate_submision()`. The tests
(or checks) are organized by group of columns tested together and by
function `test_X()`.

Each function `test_X()` checks the submission for a "category" of
checks. All `test_X()` functions are used in the `validate_submision()`
function but they also can be used individually. Each function has its
own documentation available with the command `?test_X()`

In each section, the tests are describes with detailed information that
should be provided in the json files inputted in the validation
function. This information will be noted in each section.

*Remarks:* After round 16 of COVID-19 (Jan 2023), the submission file format 
and js_def file format has been updated to follow the 
[Hubverse](https://hubdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) format. 
The documentation is about the last version of the data. For previous version, 
please consult past version of the package (version 0.0.0.9).

### `Validate_submission()` function

#### Input

To test a submission file, the function requires multiple parameters:

-   `path`: path to the submission file(s). The `SMHvalidation` package
    contains multiple examples files that can be used to test the
    function. Please refer to the package documentation for more
    information
-   `js_def`: path to a JSON file containing the round specific and
    scenario information, following the [Consortium of Infectious
    Disease Modeling Hubs
    standard](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/schemas)
-   `lst_gs`: named list of data frame containing the observed data. We
    highly recommend to use the output of the `pull_gs_data()` function
    as input. This function will generate the output in the expected
    format with the expected data. For more information, please do
    `?pull_gs_data()`. This parameter can be set to `NULL` is no
    observed data comparison is required.
-   `pop_path`: path to a table containing the population size of each
    geographical entities by FIPS (in a column "location") and by
    location name.
    
Optional parameter (only use for `"sample"` output type):

In the Scenario Modeling Hub file format two possible format are used for the
"sample" output type:

(1) All the submissions for a specific round should follow the same format 
with a predefined `output_type_id` column content. 

(2) For a specific round, the hub collect the sample "pairing" (or
joint distribution) information each team uses to generate the trajectories. In
this case, the `output_type_id` column is set to `"NA"` for the `"sample"` 
output type and the "pairing" information is collected into two columns: 
`"run_grouping"` and `"stochastic_run"`. For more information on this format,
please consult the 
[RSV Scenario Modeling Hub](https://github.com/midas-network/rsv-scenario-modeling-hub) 

To adapt to this format a parameter has been added to the validation function:

-   `merge_sample_col`: Boolean to indicate if the for the output type 
    `"sample"`, the output_type_id column is set to NA and the information is
    contained into 2 columns: `"run_grouping"` and `"stochastic_run"`. 
    By default, `FALSE`.

These parameter is ignored is the submission does not contains `"sample"` 
output type information.

##### `js_def` parameter:

The parameter should follow the standard of the `tasks.json` file from
the [Consortium of Infectious Disease Modeling Hubs
standard](https://github.com/Infectious-Disease-Modeling-Hubs/schemas).

It should contains information by rounds for:

-   "model_tasks": Array defining round-specific modeling tasks. Can
    contain one or more groups of modeling tasks per round where each
    group is defined by a distinct combination of values of task id
    variables:

    -   "tasks_ids": Group of valid values of task id variables. A set
        of valid tasks corresponding to this group is formed by taking
        all combinations of these values. (For example: origin_date,
        scenario_id, target, horizon, location, age_groups)

    -   "output_types": Object defining valid model output types for a
        given modeling task. The name of each property corresponds to
        valid values in column 'output_type' while the 'output_type_id' 
        property of each output type defines the valid values of the 
        'output_type_id' column and the 'value' property defines the 
        valid values of the 'value' column for a given output type.

    -   "target_metadata": Array of objects containing metadata about
        each unique target, one object for each unique target value.

#### Output

The function returns a message with:

-   "Error": the validation has failed and returned a message indicating
    the error(s). The error(s) should be fixed.
-   "Warning": it might be necessary to verify the input file to check
    if the warning(s) are expected or not.
-   "Success": the validation did not found any issue and returns a
    message indicating that the validation is a success.

### File format (`test_column()`)

The name and number of the columns are corresponding to the expected
format, for example:

|origin_date|scenario_id|target|horizon|location|output_type|output_type_id|value|
|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|||||||||

or 

|origin_date|scenario_id|target|horizon|location|output_type|output_type_id|run_grouping|stochastic_run|value|
|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|||||||||||

The order of the column is not important but it should contain the
expected number of columns with each name correctly spelled.

*Remarks:* In this example, the `task_ids` values correspond to:
origin_date, scenario_id, target, horizon, location.

*Remarks:*If one required column is missing, the submission test will
directly stop and return an error message without running all the other
tests.

### Scenario Information (`test_scenario()`)

-   The ID of the scenarios are corresponding to the expected ID of the
    expected round without any typo.

### Column "origin_date" (`test_origindate()`)

-   The `origin_date` column contains:
    -   one unique date value in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    -   the date in the submission file is matching the date in the name
        of the file.
    -   the date in the submission file matching the projection starting
        date or round id.

*Remarks:* Implemented since January 2022, all submissions previous to
this can have a slightly more flexible date information.

### Quantiles information and value (`test_quantile()`)

-   The submission file should contains quantiles matching the expected
    quantiles value (information should be provided via the `js_def`
    parameter), for example: `0.01`, `0.025`, `0.05`, `0.1`, `0.15`,
    `0.2`, `0.25`, `0.3`, `0.35`, `0.4`, `0.45`, `0.5`, `0.55`, `0.6`,
    `0.65`, `0.7`, `0.75`, `0.8`, `0.85`, `0.9`, `0.95`, `0.975`,
    `0.99`. **If a submission is missing some (or all) quantiles it will
    still be accepted but will not included in the Ensembles.**

-   For each target/scenario/location/(age_group, etc.) group, the value
    increases with the quantiles. For example, for the 1st week ahead of
    target X for the location Y and for the scenario A, if quantile
    `0.01`= "5" than quantile `0.5` should be equal or greater than "5".

*Remarks:* These tests are run only for file format requiring quantiles
information.

### Value and Types information (`test_val()`)

-   Each output_type/output_type_id/target/scenario/location/(age_group, etc.) 
    group combination has one unique value projected. For example: only 1
    value for quantile `0.5`, location `US`, target `inc hosp`, horizon
    `1` and, scenario `A`)

-   The projection contains the expected value (for example, integer
    value `>= 0` or numeric in between 0 and 1)

-   For each target name/scenario/location/(age group) group (except
    locations `66` (Guam), `69` (Northern Mariana Island), `60`
    (American Samoa), `74` (US. Minor Outlying Islands)), the whole
    projection does not contain only 1 unique value. For example, the
    projection for the incidence cases for one location and for one
    scenario does not contain only one unique value for the whole time
    series. **As there is a possibility that 0 death or case might be
    projected, the submission will still be accepted if the test failed
    but it will return a warning message asking to verify the
    projection.**

-   Each projected value cannot by greater than the population size of
    the corresponding geographical entity. **As an individual can be
    reinfected, the submission will still be accepted if the test failed
    but it will return a warning message asking to verify the
    projection.**

-   For the cumulative cases and deaths projection, the projected value
    should not be less than the week 0 (or week -1, depending on the
    availability on the time of submission) of the observed cumulative
    cases and deaths, respectively. The test allow a difference of 5% to
    take into account the difference between time of pulling the
    observed data, sources, ... (only tested if the `lst_gs` parameter
    is not `NULL` and contains observed cumulative cases and deaths
    value)

### Target information and value (`test_target()`)

-   The target are corresponding to the target name as expressed in the
    associated metadata JSON file.

-   The submission file contains projections for all the required
    targets. **The submission file will be accepted if some targets are
    missing, but will return a warning message and the submission might
    not be included in the Ensembles**

-   The submission file contains projection for an expected number of
    week (or horizon). **If the file contains more projected weeks than
    expected, the submission will still be accepted, but will return a
    warning message and the additional weeks will not be included in the
    visualization on the SMH website. If the file contains less
    projected weeks than expected, the submission might still be
    accepted, but will return a warning message and might not be
    included in the Ensembles, if the submission is not accepted, an
    error message will be returned.**

### Column "location" (`test_location()`)

-   The submission should contains projection by location, the
    'location' column contains the location FIPS number as available in
    the [location
    table](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/master/data-locations/locations.csv)
    in the COVID-19 SMH GitHub Repository (same table used for FLU). If
    the FIPS numbers are missing a trailing zero, the submission will be
    accepted but a warning message will be returned.

-   For the target requiring only specific location(s), no additional
    location is provided in the submission file.

*Remarks:* If a submission file contains only state level projection
(one or multiple), the `location` column might be automatically identify
as numeric even if it was submitted in a character format. In this case,
a warning message will be automatically print on the validation but,
please feel free to ignore it.

### Column "age_group" (`test_agegroup()`)

-   The submission should contain a column `age_group` with values
    defined as `<AGEMIN>-<AGEMAX>`, <AGEMIN> cannot be equal or greater
    than <AGEMAX>.

-   The submission should contain the expected `age_group`

-   For the target requiring only specific age group(s), no additional
    age group is provided in the submission file. **If additional age
    group are provided, a warning will be returned and the additional
    information might not be integrated in the analysis and
    visualization.**

*Remarks:* These tests are only run if the submission contains an
`age_group` column..

### Samples information and value (`test_sample()`)

-   The column `output_type_id` for the type 'sample' rows should only contain
    integer values.
    
-   The submission should contain a sample column with the expected number of 
    trajectory for each scenario/target/location/horizon (age_group) group

-   The submission should at least contain a unique sample identifier 
    by pairing group, for example if pairing_col = "horizon",
    the sample identifier `1` should contain at least all the possible 
    horizon value once, and optionally can contain the specific and multiple 
    value for the other task id column (`origin_date`, `scenario`, `location`, 
    `target`, `horizon`, (`age_group`, etc.))

*Remarks:* These tests are only run if the submission contains a
`sample` column.

## Validation on Metadata and Abstract

The validation for the "metadata" and the "abstract" files associated
with the submission is currently manual.

### Metadata checks

Each model is required to have metadata in `yaml` format, e.g. see
[COVID-19 example metadata
file](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/master/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/metadata-MyTeam-MyModel.txt)
and [FLU example metadata
file](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/metadata-MyTeam-MyModel.txt)
The file-name should correspond to the structure:
`metadata-[team_abbr]-[model_abbr].txt`

Each GitHub repository contains a `data-processed/METADATA.md` file
providing information on how to fill the metadata file.

#### For COVID-19 Submissions

Given the many possible approaches to modeling COVID-19 scenarios, we
are collecting relatively rich metadata, to be able to understand
heterogeneity among model projections. The information will only be used
internally, unless otherwise indicated.

### Abstract checks

An abstract file can be submitted with the projection.\
The file should be provided in an markdown (`md`) format, e.g. see
[COVID-19 round 12 template abstract
file](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/master/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/2022-01-09-MyTeam-Abstract.md).
The file-name should correspond to the structure:
`YYYY-MM-DD-[team_abbr]-[model_abbr]-Abstract.md`, with the date
corresponding to the "Start date for scenarios" for the corresponding
round (implemented starting January 2022.)

Each Round will have its specific template that should be available in
the folder `data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel` for each GitHub repository:

-   For FLU:
    <https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/tree/main/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel>
-   For COVID-19:
    <https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/tree/master/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel>
