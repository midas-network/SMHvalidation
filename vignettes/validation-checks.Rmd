The `covid19SMHvalidation` R package contains functions to pull data from the 
R package covidcast (output in the Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) standard format),
to validate and visualize Scenario Modeling Hub submission.

For more information on the Scenario Modeling Hub and on how to particiapte, 
please feel free to consult the 
[Github Repository](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/) 
and/or the [SMH website](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/).

## Validation on model projection

In this vignette, we will describe all the tests that are made on each SMH
submission when using the function `validate_submision()`. The tests (or checks)
are organized by group of columns tested together and by function `test_X()`. 

Each function `test_X()` checks the submission for a "category" of checks. All
`test_X()` functions are used in the `validate_submision()` function but they 
also can be used individually. Each function has its own documentation 
available with the command `?test_X()`

 *Remarks:*  In the `validate_submission()` function, the round information 
 (number) link to the submission is automatically extracted by using the date 
 in the submission filename and if it failed, the "scenario_id" information in 
 the submission file. By using the `test_X()` function, this information will
 have to be manually entered (Same for the 1st week target date information). 

### File format (`test_column()`)

The name and number of the columns are corresponding to the expected format:

|model_projection_date|scenario_name|scenario_id|target|target_end_date|location|type|quantile|value|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

The order of the column is not important but it should contains 9 columns with
each name correctly spelled. 

 *Remarks:* If one column is missing, the submission test will directly stop and
 return an error message without running all the other tests. 

### Scenario Information (`test_scenario()`)

 * The name and ID of the scenarios are corresponding to the expected name and
 ID of the expected round without any typo.

 * The names and ID of the scenarios are correctly matching (scenario ID A = 
 scenario name A).
 
### Column "model_projection_date" (`test_modelprojdate()`) 

 * The `model_projection_date` column contains:
     * one unique date value in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
     * the date in the submission file is matching the date in the name of the 
     file.
     * the date in the submission file matching the projection starting date.
      
 *Remarks:* Implemented since round 12 only. 
 
### Quantiles information and value (`test_quantile()`) 

 * The submission file should contains quantiles matching the expected quantiles 
 value: `0.01`, `0.025`, `0.05`, `0.1`, `0.15`, `0.2`, `0.25`, `0.3`, `0.35`, 
 `0.4`, `0.45`, `0.5`, `0.55`, `0.6`, `0.65`, `0.7`, `0.75`, `0.8`, `0.85`, 
 `0.9`, `0.95`, `0.975`, `0.99`. **If a submission is missing some (or all) 
 quantiles it will still be accepted but will not included in the Ensembles.**
 
 * Starting Round 10, two additional **optional** quantiles have been added to 
 the list: `0` and `1`. These 2 quantiles are not required. 
 
 * For each target/scenario/location group, the value increases with the 
 quantiles. For example, for the 1st week ahead of target X for the location Y
 and for the scenario A, if quantile `0.01`= "5" than quantile `0.5` should be 
 equal or greater than "5".
 
### Value and Types information (`test_val()`)
 
 * The projection contains point values that are noted as `type` = "point" and 
 `quantile` = NA
 
 * The projection contains X point values, X = number of unique targets in the 
 submission file * number of unique scenarios in the submission file * number 
 of unique locations in the submission file.
 
 * The projection contains only values greater than or equal to 0
 
 * For each target name/scenario/location group (except locations `66` (Guam), 
 `69` (Northern Mariana Island), `60` (American Samoa), `74` (US. Minor Outlying 
 Islands)), the whole projection does not contain only 1 unique value. For 
 example, the projection for the incidence cases for one location and for one
 scenario does not contain only one unique value for the whole time series. **
 As there is a possibility that 0 death or case might be projected, the 
 submission will still be accepted if the test failed but it will return a 
 warning message asking to verify the projection.**
 
 * Starting round 13: each projected value cannot by greater than the population
 size of the corresponding geographical entity. **As an individual can be 
 reinfected, the submission will still be accepted if the test failed but it
 will return a warning message asking to verify the projection.**
 
 * Starting round 13: for the cumulative cases and deaths projection, the 
 projected value should not be less than the week 0 (or week -1, depending on 
 the availability on the time of submission) of the observed cumulative cases and
 deaths, respectively. The test allow a difference of 5% to take into account
 the difference between time of pulling the observed data, sources, ...
 
 * Each quantile/target/scenario/location group combination has one unique value
 projected. For example: only 1 value for quantile `0.5`, location `US`, 
 target `1 wk ahead inc case` and, scenario `A`)
 
 
### Target information and value (`test_target()`) 
 
 * The target are corresponding to the target name as expressed in the SMH 
 Github README and wiki files: `"inc death"`, `"inc case"`, `"cum death"`, 
 `"cum case"`, `"inc hosp"`, `"cum hosp"`.
 
 * The submission file contains projections for all the targets. **The 
 submission file will be accepted if some targets are missing, but will return a
 warning message asking the team if itâ€™s correct and the submission might not be
 included in the Ensembles**
 
 * Each `target_end_date` should correspond to the end of the epiweek 
 (Saturday) and should correspond to the expected value. For example, if the 
  start date is defined as : "Start date for scenarios: January 9, 2022", than
  the `1 wk ahead` should be `"2022-01-15"`, `2 wk ahead` should be 
  `"2022-01-22"`, etc.
 
 * The submission file containg projection for an expected number of week. **If 
 the file contains more projected weeks than expected, the submission will still
 be accepted, but will return a warning message and the additional weeks will 
 not be included in the visualization on the SMH website. Starting round 13,
 if the file contains less projected weeks than expected, the submission will 
 still be accepted, but will return a warning message and might not be included 
 in the Ensembles**
 
|Round|Mininal number of weeks| Maximal number of weeks|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|1 to 9 (included)|13|26|
|10|26|52|
|11 to 12 (included)|12|12|
|13 to ...|52|52|

 
### Column "location" (`test_location()`)
 
 * The submission should contains projection by location, the 'location' column 
 contains the location FIPS number as available in the 
 [location table](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/master/data-locations/locations.csv) 
 in the SMH GitHub Repository. If the FIPS number are missing a trailing zero, 
 the submission will be accepted but a warning message will be returned.
 
*Remarks: *If a submission file contains only state level projection (one or 
multiple), the `location` column might be automatically identify as numeric even
if it was submitted in a character format. In this case, a warning message will
be automatically print on the validation but, please feel free to ignore it. 

 
## Validation on Metadata and Abstract

The validation for the "metadata" and the "abstract" files associated with 
the submission is currently manual. 

### Metadata checks

Each model is required to have metadata in `yaml` format, e.g. see 
[example metadata file](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/master/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/metadata-MyTeam-MyModel.txt).
The filename should correspond to the structure: 
`metadata-[team_abbr]-[model_abbr].txt`

Given the many possible approaches to modeling COVID-19 scenarios, we are c
ollecting relatively rich metadata, to be able to understand heterogeneity 
among model projections. The information will only be used internally, unless otherwise indicated.

### Abstract checks

Starting round 11, an optional abstract can be submitted with the projection 
file.  The file should be povided in an markdown (`md`) format, e.g. see 
[round 12 template abstract file](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/master/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/2022-01-09-MyTeam-Abstract.md).
The filename should correspond to the structure: 
`YYYY-MM-DD-[team_abbr]-[model_abbr]-Abstract.md`, with the date corresponding 
to the "Start date for scenarios" for the corresponding round (implemented
