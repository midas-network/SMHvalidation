# covid19SMHvalidation

R package containing functions to pull data from the R package covidcast 
(output in the Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) standard format), to validate and
visualize Scenario Modeling Hub submission. For more information on the 
Scenario Modeling Hub and/or on how to participate, please consult the
Scenario Modeling Hub [GitHub repository](https://github.com/midas-network/covid19-scenario-modeling-hub) or 
[website](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/)

## Installation

The package is currently only available on GitHub, to install it please follow
the next steps:

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("midas-network/covid19SMHvalidation", 
                        build_vignettes = TRUE, 
                        dependencies = TRUE,
                        ref = "main") 
```

or it can be manually installed by directly cloning/forking/downloading the 
package from GitHub.

```{r}
library(covid19SMHvalidation)
```

## Validate submission:

#### Description

The main validation function `validate_submission()` can be used to validate
Scenario Modeling Hub submissions. The function runs multiple checks, please
look at the vignette ("Validation Checks" [In Progress]) containing the list
of all the tests with detailed information. 

The function internally runs all the different validation checks functions 
(`test_column()`, `test_scenario()`, `test_modelprojdate()`, 
`test_quantiles()`, `test_val()`, `test_target()`, `test_location()`) 
on a SMH submissions and prints information about the results of each 
tests on the submission: warning(s), error(s) or if all the tests were 
successful.

For more information, each function has a documentation associated accessible
with `?validate_submission()` for example. 

#### Usage

To test a submission file, it's necessary to provide 2 argurments:

 * the path of the file to test (CSV, ZIP or GZ file format)
 * a named list of data frame containing the observed data. We highly recommend 
 to use the output of the pull_gs_data() function. The list should have the 
 same format: each data frame should be named with the corresponding `covidcast` 
 signal except "hospitalization" instead of "confirmed_admissions_covid_1d".

```{r}
lst_gs <- pull_gs_data()
validate_submission("PATH/TO/SUBMISSION", lst_gs)
```

As a warning:

  * The vast majority of submissions done in 2021 will returns an error on the 
model_projection_date column as the rules and tests on this column have been 
made and put in place only since 2022 (round 12).

  * Also the cumulative observed data for the location 39 has been corrected 
  after round 12 publication so all the submissions might have an error saying:
  `"Error: Some value(s) are inferior than the last oberved cumulative death 
count. Please check location(s): 39 "`

These 2 errors can be ignored.

## Pull "truth data":

For more information, please feel free to look at the documentation of the 
functions (`?pull_gs_data` and `?get_covidcast_data`)

#### Description

The `covid19SMHvalidation` package contains the functions `pull_gs_data()` and
`get_covidcast_data()` that download and compile data to output weekly or 
daily data, respectively, on cumulative and incidence number of cases and 
deaths, and hospitalization incidence:

  * For the cumulative numbers: use the `confirmed_cumulative_num` and 
  `deaths_cumulative_num` signals from `jhu-csse`. As the data are expressed 
  per day and the Scenario Modeling Hub uses cumulative data by epiweek, the 
  last day of each epiweek is selected for each location and the values are 
  added between all states to obtains the US level data, only in the 
  `pull_gs_data()` function.
    
  * For the incidence numbers: use the `confirmed_incidence_num` and 
  `deaths_incidence_num` signals from `jhu-csse` and 
  `confirmed_admissions_covid_1d` from `hhs`. As the data are expressed per 
  day and the Scenario Modeling Hub use cumulative data by epiweek, the sum of 
  the incidences is calculated by epiweek and by location, and the values are 
  added between all states to obtains the US level data, only in the 
  `pull_gs_data()` function.

#### Source

For the cases and deaths data, the data are coming from the JHU CSSE group and
for the  hospitalization incidence, the data are extracted from the 
HealthData.gov COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State 
Daily and Timeseries datasets. 

To access all these data we use the `covidcast` R package. A package using the 
COVIDcast Epidata API maintained by the Delphi Research Group at Carnegie 
Mellon University. Please see 
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/covidcast/index.html), 
for more information. 

#### Usage

For the `pull_gs_data()` function:

```{r}
# Store the output in an object
lst_gs <- pull_gs_data()

# Look at the structure of the object
str(lst_gs)

# Print the output
lst_gs
```

For the `get_covidcast_data()` function:

```{r}
# Store the output in an object
df <- get_covidcast_data()

# Look at the structure of the object
str(df)

# Print the output
df
```
