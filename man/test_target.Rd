\strong{DEPRECATED} \if{html}{\out{<br>}}\if{html}{\out{<br>}}
Validate Scenario Modeling Hub submissions: test if the
\code{target} column contain the expected information and value.
}
\details{
This function tests:
\itemize{
\item Target name: The target should correspond to the target name as
expressed in the \code{model_task} parameter.
\item Target number: The submission file contains projection for all
required targets. It is accepted to submit only a subset of target but
a warning and/or a error message will be return (depending if the target
is optional or required).
\item Number of week projected: The submission file contains projections
for the expected number of weeks or more. If a team submits more week than
expected, an error message will be returned. An error message will also be
returned if the submission file contains less projection week than expected.
Starting Feb. 2022, if the file
contains less projected weeks than expected, the submission will still be
accepted, but will return a warning message and might not be included
in the Ensembles.
\item Week projected: The submission file contains projection for all
expected weeks for each tasks group (unique combination of \code{task_ids}
columns as specified in the \code{model_task} parameter) and for all
output type combination.
\item NA target: The projection contains \code{NA} value in the \code{horizon}
column for the target(s) requiring no time series information (for example,
\code{"peak size hosp"}).
}

\code{model_task} should match a specific round model tasks from the
\code{tasks.json} associated with the hub. The json is expected to follow
the \href{https://hubverse.io/en/latest/user-guide/hub-config.html}{hubverse}
schema at least version 5.0

As the function was deprecated, it will not be updated anymore. It was
updated a last time to match the 5.0 hubverse schema version. However, it
might returns duplicated message output.
